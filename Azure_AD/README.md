# Authorization for Azure AD  via MS Graph API

Using SAML and Graph API to authorize by Azure AD groups

## Scenario

A company using Azure Active Directory that has more than 150 user groups for any users and is using SAML for authentication.  There is a size restriction in the SAML assertion which causes no groups to be returned through the normal SAML assertion.

The implementation comes from [Microsoft identity platform and the OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow) article.

>The OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant flow permits a web service (confidential client) to use its own credentials, instead of impersonating a user, to authenticate when calling another web service.

### Prerequisites

* Must have administrator access to a Microsoft Azure Active Directory tenant.
* Must have administrator access to the Admin UI of the Appgate SDP Controller.
* Must have authtentication provided by SAML for MS Azure AD.

## Azure AD setup

Follow the [Authentication and authorization basics for Microsoft Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth/auth-concepts) article via the Application Permissions.  Use the [Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2) article to register the Appgate SDP controller.

## Appgate Controller setup

1. Login to Appgate Controller Admin UI
1. Navigate to **Identity** > **User Claim Scripts**
    1. Click **Add New**
    1. Provide name
    1. Replace JavaScript with code from [GraphAPI_Azure.js](./GraphAPI_Azure.js) file
    1. Update variables in code by following instructions at top of JavaScript code 
    1. Click **Save**
1. Navigate to **Identity** > **Identity Providers** 
    1. Select IDP that uses the SAML to authenticate against MS Azure AD
    1. Map Attributes to User Claims
